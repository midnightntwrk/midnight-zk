Midnight Circuits is a library designed for implementing circuits with [Halo2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2). It is built on the [PSE v0.4.0 release](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2/releases/tag/v0.4.0) of Halo2, incorporating a few [minor additions](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/halo2/commits/dev/) required to support Midnight Circuits.

> **Disclaimer**: This library has not been audited. Use it at your own risk.

## Features

Midnight Circuits provides several tools to facilitate circuit development with Halo2. These include:

1. Native and non-native field operations.
2. Native and non-native elliptic-curve operations.
3. Native and non-native hash-to-curve functionality.
4. Bit/Byte decomposition tools and range-checks.
5. SHA-256.
6. Set (non-)membership.

We aim to expose these functionalities via traits, which can be found in `[src/instructions]`.

## ZkStdLib

Midnight Circuits includes the `ZkStdLib`, which encapsulates the functionality required by Midnight. This library has a fixed configuration, meaning you cannot choose the number of columns, lookups, or gates. If you require this flexibility, you should build a circuit without using `ZkStdLib`.

The motivations for a fixed configuration are:

1. Simplified reasoning for recursion.
2. The verifier can perform pre-parsing of circuits since they all have the same structure.

`ZkStdLib` also serves as an abstraction layer, allowing developers to focus on circuit logic rather than the configuration and chip creation. Developers only need to implement the `Relation` trait, avoiding the boilerplate of Halo2's `Circuit`. For example, to prove knowledge of a SHA preimage:

```rust
use midnight_curves::G1Affine;
use midnight_proofs::{
    circuit::{Layouter, Value},
    plonk::Error,
};
use midnight_circuits::{
    compact_std_lib::{self, MidnightCircuit, Relation, ShaTableSize, ZkStdLib, ZkStdLibArch},
    instructions::{AssignmentInstructions, PublicInputInstructions},
    testing_utils::plonk_api::filecoin_srs,
    types::{AssignedByte, Instantiable},
};
use rand::{rngs::OsRng, Rng, SeedableRng};
use rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng;
use sha2::Digest;

type F = midnight_curves::Fq;

// In this example we show how to build a circuit for proving the knowledge of a
// SHA256 preimage. Concretely, given public input x, we will argue that we know
// w âˆˆ {0,1}^192 such that x = SHA-256(w).

#[derive(Clone)]
struct ShaPreImageCircuit;

impl Relation for ShaPreImageCircuit {
    // When defining a circuit, one must clearly state the instance and the witness
    // of the underlying NP-relation.
    type Instance = [u8; 32];
    type Witness = [u8; 24]; // 192 = 24 * 8

    // We must specify how the instance is converted into raw field elements to
    // be process by the prover/verifier. The order here must be consistent with
    // the order in which public inputs are constrained/assigned in [circuit].
    fn format_instance(instance: &Self::Instance) -> Vec<F> {
        instance
            .iter()
            .flat_map(AssignedByte::<F>::as_public_input)
            .collect()
    }

    // Define the logic of the NP-relation being proved.
    fn circuit(
        &self,
        std_lib: &ZkStdLib,
        layouter: &mut impl Layouter<F>,
        _instance: Value<Self::Instance>,
        witness: Value<Self::Witness>,
    ) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let assigned_input = std_lib.assign_many(layouter, &witness.transpose_array())?;
        let output = std_lib.sha256(layouter, &assigned_input)?;
        output
            .iter()
            .try_for_each(|b| std_lib.constrain_as_public_input(layouter, b))
    }

    fn write_relation<W: std::io::Write>(&self, _writer: &mut W) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    fn read_relation<R: std::io::Read>(_reader: &mut R) -> std::io::Result<Self> {
        Ok(ShaPreImageCircuit)
    }
}

// An upper bound on the log2 of the number of rows in the circuit.
// The closer to the real value, the better, but you do not have to worry too much.
const K: u32 = 14;
let mut srs = filecoin_srs(K);

let relation = ShaPreImageCircuit;

// The actual k needed by this circuit is 13. We can downsize it automatically.
compact_std_lib::downsize_srs_for_relation(&mut srs, &relation);

let vk = compact_std_lib::setup_vk(&srs, &relation);
let pk = compact_std_lib::setup_pk(&relation, &vk);

// Sample a random preimage as the witness.
let mut rng = ChaCha8Rng::from_entropy();
let witness: [u8; 24] = core::array::from_fn(|_| rng.gen());
let instance = sha2::Sha256::digest(witness).into();

let proof = compact_std_lib::prove::<ShaPreImageCircuit, blake2b_simd::State>(
    &srs, &pk, &relation, &instance, witness, OsRng,
)
.expect("Proof generation should not fail");
assert!(
    compact_std_lib::verify::<ShaPreImageCircuit, blake2b_simd::State>(
        &srs.verifier_params(),
        &vk,
        &instance,
        None,
        &proof
    )
    .is_ok()
)
```

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). To capture
the changes that do not affect the API, do not add any new functionality, but
are breaking changes, we increment the `MAJOR` version. This happens when the
circuit is modified for performance or bug fixes; the modification of the
verification keys break backwards compatibility.

* MAJOR: Incremented when you make incompatible API or VK changes
* MINOR: Incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
* PATCH: Incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
