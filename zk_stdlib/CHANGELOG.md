# Changelog

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). To capture
the changes that do not affect the API, do not add any new functionality, but
are breaking changes, we increment the `MAJOR` version. This happens when the
circuit is modified for performance or bug fixes; the modification of the
verification keys break backwards compatibility.

* MAJOR: Incremented when you make incompatible API or VK changes
* MINOR: Incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
* PATCH: Incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
